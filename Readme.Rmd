### ASF meta-population model   

Based on ASF simulation model from Pepin et al. 2022, Optimizing response to an introduction of African Swine Fever in wild pigs, converted from Matlab to R/C++.    

All scripts/objects to run model should be here, with exception of two datasets used to model direct/indirect contact.

Email kim.m.pepin@usda.gov to request these datasets to run model. Else, just comment out references to ModelStateData.R and input parameters separately.    

Readme/scripts updated periodically.
