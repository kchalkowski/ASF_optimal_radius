Warning: this file/format is in development. Proceed with caution. Godspeed!

Changes needed:
1. remove state switch, just add way to put in parameters manually that state switch gets
2. add regex for all parameters
3. write how to

#############################
#### How to use this file ###
#############################

All parameters start with a '~'. this is how they are regex'd into a list with the SetParameters function. All parameteres are described starting with the *. This is not regex'd anywhere, but is formatted this way for clarity.

To add a new parameter, just use the following format. Make sure there's a space between '='

# ~ Parm = val

To temporarily remove a parameter, just remove the ~ and they will be ignored

###########################
#### General parameters ###
###########################
* nrep, number of replicates
* thyme, total number of time steps. is spelled 'thyme' bc 'time' is a function in stats namespace 

~ nrep = 2
~ thyme = 10

############################
#### Movement parameters ###
############################

* shape, gamma distribution shape parameter
* rate, gamma distribution rate parameter

These are original movement gamma distribution parameters from Kim's state switch model (FL= slow pigs, SC= fast pigs)
xFL=c(0.7515,0.3550)
xSC=c(0.5657,1.9082)

If using movement parameters fed in from landscapes, remove the ~

~ shape = 0.7515
~ rate = 0.3550

##################################
#### Movement option settings ####
##################################
* mv_pref, movement preference switch
  0=random movement preference (distance-only)
  1=abundance-avoidance movement preference
  2=rsf preference (only works when pop_init_grid_opts="heterogeneous" and grid_opts!="homogeneous")
  
~ mv_pref=3

###########################
#### Contact parameters ###
###########################

* F1, pig contact probability if in same cell, numeric
	F1 FL - 0.7380952
	F1 SC - 0.9375
* F2, pig contact probability with distance, glm model object
* F2i, pig contact probability with distance from 'carcass', glm model object
	^ currently, F2 and F2i need to be read in as glms as rds objects. 
	in future, want to manually input the intercept and coefficient

Originally, these were all pulled into model with 'ModelStateSwitch.R' by reading in pairwise contact data from field studies

~ F1 = 0.7380952

# just subbing in these values for now
~ F2_int = 0.7380952
~ F2_B = 0.015 
~ F2i_int = 0.7380952
~ F2i_B = 0.015

##################################
#### Pig population parameters ###
##################################

* density, pigs/km2. Recommended density levels: 1.5, 3, 5 pigs/km2
* ss, sounder size
* B1, probability of infection given contact

For now, sounder size (ss) and probability of infection given contact (B1) will be automatically determined based on input density levels as follows:
	FL:
		density 1.5, ss=2, B1=0.9
		density 3, ss=4, B1=0.4
		density 5, ss=6, B1=0.2
	SC:
		density 1.5, ss=2, B1=0.009
		density 3, ss=4, B1=0.004
		density 5, ss=6, B1=0.002

B2?? automatically calculated as B1*0.5

~ density = 1.5

##############################
#### Grid option settings ####
##############################

These two parameters only need to be set if manually creating heterogeneous or homogeneous grids. If using a raster/raster collection, no need:
* len, nrow/ncol of grid. note that there is only one number for the grid dimensions! grid must be square
* inc, resolution of the grid in kilometers

~ len=200
~ inc=0.4 

* grid.opts, character, grid option for input type and whether to incorporate land class if creating grid from scratch. If using a raster input, you can ignore this input. If inputting a raster to the InitializeGrids function, this value defaults to 'ras'. If making a grid by inputting len/inc, default is homogeneous.
	ras- use input raster to create grid
	homogeneous- creates grid with 7 columns, no land class variables
    heterogeneous- creates a neutral random landscape model with land class values draw from uniform distribution and rescaled from 0 to 1. Note, if pop_init_grid_opts='heterogeneous', grid.opts MUST be something other than 'homogeneous or InitializeSounders will throw an error.
* pop_init_grid_opts = how to initialize sounders on the grid-- do it with biased preference according to lscape vals or just randomly   


~ grid.opts = "homogenous"
~ pop_init_grid_opts = "homogenous"

#### Movement option settings ####
##################################
* mv_pref, movement preference switch
  0=random movement preference (distance-only)
  1=abundance-avoidance movement preference
  2=rsf preference (only works when pop_init_grid_opts="heterogeneous" and grid_opts!="homogeneous")
  
~ mv_pref=0
  
#################################
#### Surveillance parameters ####
#################################
* detectday, Timestep of simulation to start surveillance. Yes it's named 'detectday' even though timesteps are in weeks.

~ detectday=73
  
* DetP, probability of infected pigs sampled as positive. for now, is just used as an input in some of the sounderlocs output processing steps. later, may be integrated into culling/surveillance process within simulation.

~ DetP=1 

* sample, option to include specific sampling scheme for a county. Sample format for this file can be found here: "Input/sampling_scheme_template.csv"
* This feature currently requires a county landclass preference file to construct grid. Initial implementation required county shapefile but this is deprecated.

~ sampling = 0

#############################
#### Culling parameters #####
#############################
* alphaC, scaling parameter on relationship of effort to capture success
* Rad=0, culling radius
* intensity=0.05, proportion of population targeted for removal per day based on capabilities
* cullstyle="startOUT", option in original ASF opt rad 2022 model
* Intensity = 0.05, proportion of population targeted for removal per day based on capabilities

~ alphaC = 1.1
~ Rad = 0
~ intensity = 0.05
~ cullstyle = "startOUT"
~ Intensity = 0.05

#####################################
#### Epidemiological parameters #####
#####################################

* Pir, proportion of individuals that recover instead of die
* num_inf_0=1, how many pigs to infect starting off
* Pcr, transition probability from carcass to removal from landscape

~ Pir = 0.05
~ num_inf_0 = 1
~ Pcr = 0.23

#########################################
#### Population dynamics parameters #####
#########################################

* death, probability of natural death
* Pbd, weekly birth rate

~ death = 0.00639
~ Pbd = 0.0192

#########################
#### Output options #####
#########################

* out.opts, character vector of selected output options. options include "sounderlocs","idzone","alldetections","incidence". if none selected (i.e., out.opts=c()), just get standard outputs

	** sounderlocs: subset of pop matrix taken at each timestep: rows where there is a pig in any state, number in each status, and the cell number (location). first col is timestep number. this can get quite large-- not good practice to just merge across 500-1000 reps. summary options for replicates: sum of num SEIRCZ across each timestep, each replicate (tracking population/state changes)

	** idzone: matrix with timestep in first column, second column is each cell within control zone at each timestep. This can also get quite large. Mostly for plotting/visualization for checking individual replicates. No cross-replicate summary options at the moment.

	** alldetections: matrix with each row timestep, col1 timestep, col2=type (1 is live, 0 is dead), col3 is number of live/dead detected at each timestep, col4 is locations of detections. cross replicate summary-- just add rep column, rbind for each replicate. for now only include number.. later can add opt to output locs if/when needed

	** incidence: matrix with timestep, num exposed, num infected, and assoc. locs. can get large, cross-replicate summaries for now ignore locs, just summarise num exp/inf across timestep. in future, will add num susc to this to calculate different measures of Rt.

~ out.opts = c("sounderlocs")
