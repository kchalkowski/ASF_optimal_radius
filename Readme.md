# Spatial meta-population model   

Based on ASF simulation model from Pepin et al. 2022, Optimizing response to an introduction of African Swine Fever in wild pigs, converted from Matlab to R/C++.    

Readme/scripts updated periodically.    

## Steps to run simulation
* clone repo to your machine
* store contact data files in Input folder (email kim.m.pepin@usda.gov or kayleigh.chalkowski@usda.gov for these files)
* set home directory in RunASFSimReplicates.R to your ASF_optimal_radius path
* if needed, change parameters in SetParameters.R
