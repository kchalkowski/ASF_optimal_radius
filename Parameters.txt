Warning: this file/format is in development. Proceed with caution. Godspeed!

Changes needed:
1. remove state switch, just add way to put in parameters manually that state switch gets
2. add regex for all parameters
3. write how to

#############################
#### How to use this file ###
#############################

All parameters start with a '~' -- this is how they are regex'd into a list with the SetParameters function. 

To add a new parameter, just use the following format:

~ Parm = val

To temporarily remove a parameter, just remove the ~ and they will be ignored

###########################
#### General parameters ###
###########################
Change how the model is run

Set number of replicates to run
~ nrep = 2

############################
#### Movement parameters ###
############################

These are original movement gamma distribution parameters from Kim's state switch model (FL= slow pigs, SC= fast pigs)
xFL=c(0.7515,0.3550)
xSC=c(0.5657,1.9082)

If using movement parameters fed in from landscapes, remove the ~

~ shape = 0.7515
~ rate = 0.3550

###########################
#### Contact parameters ###
###########################

originally, these were pulled into model with 'ModelStateSwitch.R' by reading in pairwise contact data from field studies

F1, pig contact probability if in same cell, numeric
	F1 FL - 0.7380952
	F1 SC - 0.9375
F2, pig contact probability with distance, glm model object
F2i, pig contact probability with distance from 'carcass', glm model object
	^ currently, F2 and F2i need to be read in as glms as rds objects. 
	in future, want to manually input the intercept and coefficient

~ F1 = 0.7380952

##################################
#### Pig population parameters ###
##################################

Recommended density levels: 1.5, 3, 5 pigs/km2
For now, sounder size (ss) and probability of infection given contact (B1) will be automatically determined based on input density levels as follows:
	FL:
		density 1.5, ss=2, B1=0.9
		density 3, ss=4, B1=0.4
		density 5, ss=6, B1=0.2
	SC:
		density 1.5, ss=2, B1=0.009
		density 3, ss=4, B1=0.004
		density 5, ss=6, B1=0.002

B2?? automaically calculated as B1*0.5

~ density = 1.5

#################################
#### Surveillance parameters ####
#################################

Timestep of simulation to start surveillance. Yes it's named 'detectday' even though timesteps are in weeks.

~ detectday=73

##############################
#### Grid option settings ####
##############################

These two parameters only need to be set if manually creating heterogeneous or homogeneous grids. If using a raster/raster collection, no need:
len, nrow/ncol of grid. note that there is only one number for the grid dimensions! grid must be square
inc, resolution of the grid in kilometers

~ len=200
~ inc=0.4 

grid.opts, character, grid option for input type and whether to incorporate land class if creating grid from scratch. If using a raster input, you can ignore this input. If inputting a raster to the InitializeGrids function, this value defaults to 'ras'. If making a grid by inputting len/inc, default is homogeneous.
	ras- use input raster to create grid
	homogeneous- creates grid with 7 columns, no land class variables
    heterogeneous- creates a neutral random landscape model with land class values draw from uniform distribution and rescaled from 0 to 1. Note, if pop_init_grid_opts='heterogeneous', grid.opts MUST be something other than 'homogeneous or InitializeSounders will throw an error.

~ grid.opts = "homogeneous"

#sounderlocs:
#subset of pop matrix taken at each timestep: 
#rows where there is a pig in any state, number in each status, and the cell number (location)
#first col is timestep number
#this can get quite large-- not good practice to just merge across 500-1000 reps
#summary options for replicates: sum of num SEIRCZ across each timestep, each replicate (tracking population/state changes)

#idzone
#matrix with timestep in first column, second column is each cell within control zone at each timestep
#This can also get quite large. Mostly for plotting/visualization for checking individual replicates.
#No cross-replicate summary options at the moment.

#alldetections:
#matrix with each row timestep,
#col1 timestep, col2=type (1 is live, 0 is dead), col3 is number of live/dead detected at each timestep, col4 is locations of detections
#cross replicate summary-- just add rep column, rbind for each replicat
#for now only include number.. later can add opt to output locs if/when needed

#incidence:
#matrix with timestep, num exposed, num infected, and assoc. locs.
#can get large, cross-replicate summaries for now ignore locs, just summarise num exp/inf across timestep
#in future, will add num susc to this to calculate different measures of Rt.
